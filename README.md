Multiple Linear Regression:



Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a fundamental regression algorithm within the domain of supervised machine learning, designed to address regression problems. Its purpose is to model and predict a continuous dependent variable based on the linear relationship it shares with two or more independent variables.





Critical Assumptions for Robust Modelling:



  Linearity: 

    A linear relationship must exist between the dependent 

    variable and each independent variable. This implies that 

    changes in the independent variables produce  

    proportional changes in the dependent variable.



  Absence of Multicollinearity:

    The independent variables should exhibit minimal correlation

    with each other. High correlation (multicollinearity) can lead to  

    unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates, hindering the  

    model's interpretability.



  Homoscedasticity: 

    The variance of the residuals (the differences between 

    observed and predicted values) should be constant across all 

    levels of the independent variables. This ensures that the 

    model's prediction errors are consistent.

  

  Normality of Residuals:

    The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This

    assumption is crucial for statistical inference, hypothesis 

    testing, and the validity of confidence intervals.



  Absence of Endogeneity:

    There should be no correlation between the error terms and 

    the independent variables. Endogeneity can introduce bias 

    into the model's estimates, leading to inaccurate predictions.
